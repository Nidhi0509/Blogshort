    <br><br><p>Which is your favorite book??</p>
        <p>The Alchemist? The Da Vinci Code? or The Twilight?
        or are you just completely fascinated by the complete HARRY POTTER series?</p>
        <p>Can you tell why so?</p>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what makes you like certain books and dislike the others?</p>

        <p>Which are the books that you can just go on reading for hours and which ones will make you feel bored??</p>

        <p>So many questions.. and ONE SINGLE ANSWER.. You can easily relate to them.. You feel so connected to the book at one go or are so fascinated with the main idea that you can just finish the book in a couple of days.. (P.S.- just like when you end up watching a complete season of web series in a single night :-D)
        A person who loves thrill, might not like a romantic book which highlights the importance of love and trust in a long distance relationship. Likewise, a person who is terrified by the idea of ghosts would not like to read a horror story. So its simple, the genre of books that you like depends on the type of person you are, your likes, dislikes and some inner characteristic traits.
        Coming to the word BIBLIOPHILE – person who loves books. What do you think? Does he actually loves to read all genre of books? Or does he loves the idea in them and loves to explore a whole new world through the books?
        Bibliophile is the one who reads a lot of books, and basically has a sense of empathy in them while reading. He just doesn’t read for the sake of reading, he reads because he explores a new perception to different things out there. While reading science fiction, there is a probability that he is so amazed by the idea behind that.. ( maybe he feels just out of the world while reading). On the other hand while reading non fiction books such as autobiographies of legendary people, he might be looking for some sense of inspiration.
        The more a person reads, the more he widens his horizon of understanding things better.</p>
        <p>Some people just can’t develop the habit of reading, probably because they start reading books which they cannot relate to. (P.S. Probably that is the reason why Krish in the movie 2 States, released in 2014 says “Story me hero ho ya na ho, story hero honi chahie”.
        Each book is great! You just need to find the right one for you! <br>
        It depends on what is read. And in our time things have con­spired to place obstacles in the path of the person who has the capacity to use books as instruments of his own upgrading.
        <br>Books play a significant role in our life. They say that “When you open a book, you open a new world”. I believe that everyone would agree with this statement as books have become inevitable to mankind. For the majority of people, books are part of their everyday life.  A book is like a best friend who will never walk away from you.
        <br>Books are packed with knowledge, insights into a happy life, life lessons, love, fear, prayer and helpful advice. One can read about anything under the sun. Books have been here for centuries and without them today’s knowledge of our past ancestors, cultures and civilizations would have been impossible. Have you ever thought what would have happened if intellectuals never documented their studies?</p>
