    <h1>Nature as an engine of recovery in a post-Coronavirus world</h1>
    <h3><pre><a href="#">Valerie Hickey,Anna Wellenstien</a>     <a href="#">April 22, 2020 </a>       <a href="#">Categorized</a>                          </pre></h3>
    <p>As most of us spend this Earth Day sheltering at home to flatten the COVID-19 curve, our hearts and thanks go out to all the people on the frontlines of this battle – the healthcare workers and the grocery shop stockers, those making deliveries, the pharmacists, the farmers, and the fishers. And our hearts go out to the people who are standing on the precipice of a steep economic contraction, with their jobs and livelihoods in jeopardy, if not already lost.
        <br>
        What matters today is how we flatten the curve.  What will matter tomorrow is how we stimulate economic recovery, bringing back better jobs and more of them to ensure that today’s investment in recovering economies sets the stage for longer-term green, clean, and resilient growth … one that builds a path out of poverty into the middle class.  In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), we can’t do this without thinking about how to put natural capital to work for its people.
        <br>
        The region is rich in natural capital and it already plays a major role in the livelihoods of many, with 49% of the total area of LAC covered by forests.  That’s 935 million hectares, representing approximately 22% of the forest area existing in the world, and almost half the land area of Latin America.
        <br>
        From our land and our seas
        <br>
        Almost 40 million people live in these forests and depend on them entirely for their livelihoods, mostly in the Amazon. But forests are important for more than just Latin America’s forest peoples. Globally, the formal timber sector employs more than 13 million people, 1.3 million of whom work in LAC, amounting to one-half of 1% of LAC’s entire workforce. The formal contribution of the forest sector to LAC’s economy amounted to almost $50 billion (at 2011 prices). But the timber sector’s economic contribution is much larger – the sector is mainly informal and its value remains largely unreported.  
        <br>
        In LAC, more than 73 million people live in houses that use forest products as the main building material, accounting for 12% of the total number of households. So, if we want a steep recovery that positions the region where domestic and global demand is growing, forests are a great place to invest.
        <br>
        And it’s not just forests. Fish are aplenty in the LAC region as well. By 2030, the region is expected to see a 24% growth in fish production from fisheries and aquaculture – from almost 13 million tonnes to 16 million tonnes per year. Almost 4 million people work in aquaculture in the region. But there is room to expand this to meet growing global demand. Aquaculture is the world's fastest-growing food industry, at 7% per year, accounting for more than 50% of fish for human consumption. In order to maintain current per capita fish consumption, by 2030 aquaculture must produce 28.8 million more tonnes per year than at present.
        <br>
        By 2018, with more than 2.5 million tonnes of aquaculture produced, LAC still only accounts for less than 5% of global production. While Chile, Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico account for more than 80% of the regional aquaculture volume, this activity is carried out on various scales in virtually all countries of the region, contributing significantly to food security, employment, and foreign currency generation. So, there is a lot more opportunity here, too, for aligning recovery objectives with global, green, and blue market opportunities.
        <br>
        But fisheries isn’t just aquaculture. There are at least 2,500 small-scale fishing communities dotted across the region who produce food for domestic consumption and earn important income doing so. In the Brazilian Amazon, for example, households obtain 30% of their income from fishing. FAO expects to see fish consumption increase in the region alone by 22 % between now and 2025. This is a market opportunity waiting to be taken.
